  <h2>Less Formally Known as Rebellars</h2>

  <p> I am a 23, well almost, year old female living in Atlanta, GA! I went to the University of Georgia and was a Marketing Major with an Emphasis in Digital. What I didn't know was that the learning really never ends, this is my second course with General Assembly. I have a love of travel & plan on moving to New York or Philadelphia in the coming months. I'm adventerous & love any kind of music (except screamo). Here are some fun facts about me:</p>

<ul>
  <li class="others">Currently, my favorite color is this salmon pink you see as my background</li>
  <li>I have been to 4 continents</li>
  <li class="others">Current favorite show is: Bobs Burgers</li>
  <li>I was born in Indianapolis and took a flight 3 days later to ATL and have never gone back</li>
  <li class="others">Book I'm currently reading: Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell</li>
  <li>I'm a big podcast fan, I'm currently listening to: Broken Record, Revisionist History, and My Favorite Murder</li>
</ul>
